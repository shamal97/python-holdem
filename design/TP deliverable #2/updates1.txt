Updates

All I had before was the board and randomly generated cards for each player

Now I have the betting process with the next player starting every turn, it knows
whe the "pot is right", so that it can go on to the next stage. It has the flop, 
turn, and river, as well as the start of computing who has won the hand. So far
for computing who was won the hand, all I have is the highest card, without much
of a way for doing ties (needs to be worked on). I also have it keeping track of 
each players chips. The decisions are made randomly for the AIs currently, and the
user only has the option to call (works for troubleshooting my other problems).
I think this is a minimum viable product but I plan to have a working AI and being 
able to calculate for all poker hands, as well as something for when a player runs
out of chips.
