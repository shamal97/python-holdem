#Texas Holdem in Python
My project is a version of limit poker, with the user against computer players.
The user as well as the computer players make their decision when it is their
turn and the new cards come out when everyone who has stayed in has bet the
same amount, and a new round of betting occurs. At the end of the last round 
of betting, the player who has the best hand that has stayed in gets the chips
in the pot. When a player is left with zero chips, they are out of the game
and if the user is the last player remaining, they win the game. If the user
is brought down to zero chips, the user loses, and has to start a new game in 
order to keep playing. 

To run my project open the 112poker.py file and run it.

The project only uses TKinter and no other modules.
